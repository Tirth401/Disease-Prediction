# Disease-Prediction

## Overview
This project is a machine learning-based system designed to predict diseases based on the symptoms provided by the user. The model is trained to recognize 40 different symptoms, such as Continuous Sneezing, Chills, Nodal Skin Eruptions, Headache, etc., and can predict the most likely disease out of a predefined list, including conditions like Fungal Infection, Allergy, and more.

## Features
- **Input Symptoms:** The user can input up to 4 symptoms from a list of 40.
- **Disease Prediction:** Based on the provided symptoms, the system predicts the most likely disease.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The system is designed to be simple and intuitive to use, making it accessible for users without a technical background.

## Dataset
The model is trained on a dataset containing records of symptoms and corresponding diseases. The dataset includes 40 different symptoms and multiple disease categories.
